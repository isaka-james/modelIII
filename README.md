# model-III 
## How it started?
 
###### This is called model-III that means that there was model-I and model-II, well.. I started this fun project cause of my friend who loves betting/gambling saying that can't I use the my knowledge to predict the football matches,, that is where I started to build this thing, I started building the model-I, which was very basic but to the conclusion I agreed that it was not worth it so I restarted again the idea by clearing all the codes, the Model-II was really impressed me cause out of 10 matches it predicted 8 matches correctly which it was in Tanzania Premier League,, Later I wanted to update the model so I made it to take various datas instead of 14 datas that were used previously, so I developed MODEL-III.
##### You can see that when the program is run you can see the results/prefiction of the matches.
### Features 
   + Remember to install **pandas**, and **requests** in your machine.
   + Predict four Leagues **England**,**Tanzania**,**Egypt** and **France** premier Leagues.
   + I prefer you to inputs the true values that are required by the program. So as to get the accurate predictions.
### The Tests 
   + Model-II is **70%** accurate on average on all leagues.
   + Model-III is **85%** accurate on average on all leagues.
#### The Tests were done for one week each day I tested 10 matches.
#### Because I know the Tanzania league very well so I made model-II such that it's accuracy in predict Tanzania League is **95%** accuracy.
